# Hora Pure Front Panel

The Hora Pure firmware for Radio Music is super fun! This repo contains the Eagle PCB files for a black+copper front panel that works well with the Pure firmware. The files are specifically made to be used with the OSHpark After Dark PCB service, and that's how the one pictured below was manufactured.

Have fun!
